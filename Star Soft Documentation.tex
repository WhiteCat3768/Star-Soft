\section{Introduction:}

Plasmium is a text-based Python modeling software that allows users to set up and run simulations of stellar cores. It models the evolution of elemental mass fractions, electron and positron concentrations, core temperature, and neutrino flux, but does not simulate plasma dynamics.

Designed as an open-source educational tool, Plasmium is freely available for non-commercial use without restrictions. It is intended for students and enthusiasts rather than for high-level astrophysical research.

If you are a student or an amateur researcher, Plasmium provides all the essential tools you need. However, if you are a professional astrophysicist seeking advanced modeling capabilities, I recommend using MESA.

\section{Measuresment system:}

The entirety of the software uses a custom measurement system called SA which stands for an old placeholder name of the tool ''Star Astro'' with core units being: gramm, year, santimeter, mole, Kelvin, elemental charge, Gauss.

Secondary units are called SA[name]. Here are ratios between all major SA units and their SI counterparts:

\vspace{1em}

\noindent - SAJoul $\approx$ $10^{22}$ Joul \\
- SAWatt $\approx$ $3,154 \times 10^{29}$ Watt \\
- SAPascal $\approx$ $10^{16}$ Pascal \\

\section{Requiered external libraries:}

If n is concentration of nuclei with half-life T, time is t, then:

\[
n(t) = \frac{n_0}{2^{\frac{t}{T}}}
\]

Then we can calculate the derivative of the concentration over time:

\[
\dot{n} = \frac{dn}{dt} = \frac{-n_0 \cdot \ln(2)}{T \cdot 2^{\frac{t}{T}}}
\]

And since on every step of calculation we act as t = 0, that can be transformed into:

\[\dot{n} = \frac{dn}{dt} = \frac{-n_0 \cdot \ln(2)}{T}\]

\[\frac{dn_i}{dt} = -a\sum_{i = 1}^{k} R_i\],

where for nuclei i with k reactions that include it where "a" is nuclear factor coresnonding to nuclei "i" (a is positive if nuclei i is in right side of nuclear equation and vice versa).

Then it calculates there burning times using there concentrations. If burning speed of an element is negative then there burning time is simply concentration divided by burning speed:

\[t_i = \frac{n_i}{\dot{n_i}}\], where $t_i$ is burning time of nuclei "i", $n_i$ is its current concentration and $\dot{n}$ is its bruning speed.

Else if burning speed of an element is positive:

\[t_i = \frac{n_{max_i} - n_i}{-\dot{n_i}}\], where everything is the same despite $n_{max}$ is its maximum possible concentration of nuclei "i" which is calculated like:

\[n_{max} = \frac{\rho}{m_i \cdot M_{nuc}}\]

The same thing (excluding max concentration) is repeated for electrons and positrons and temperature of the core.

If burning speed of electrons is negative:

\[t_{e-} = \frac{n_{e-}}{-\dot{n_{e-}}}\]

otherwise:

\[t_{e-} = \infty\]

Same for positrons:

\[t_{e+} = \frac{n_{e+}}{-\dot{n_{e+}}}\]

otherwise:

\[t_{e+} = \infty\]

And for temperature if its` change speed is negative (temperature change here is calculated based on dt with Temperature\_change\_speed\_count(<...>) method.):

\[t_{T} = \frac{T}{-\dot{T}}\]

otherwise if it is poritive:

\[t_{T} = \infty\]

Then minimum of burning times of electrons, positrons, elements and core temperature change is multiplied by less then zero ratio called Courant`s number ("Speed" in code) and the result is the time step of the modeling (dt in code). It also uses modified explicit Euler`s method but multiplies step of time axis by Courant`s number between 0 and 1 which helps it to stay stable:

\[t_{step} = min(t) \cdot C\]

Here $\alpha$ and $n$ are technical parameters. $\alpha$ is needed to avoid effects of general relativity and should be kept below $0.1$. $n$ determines the width of energy range that is used to calculate cross-sections of resonant reactions (range of n resonance full widths from resonance energy in both directions).

Also, both integrals are normalized using Integration\_trapz(x, y) method. But that is only a  technical correction with change due to that usually being less then one millioth and quickly decreasing with the increase of Point\_of\_calculation parameter.

$\sigma(E)$ comes from Breit-Wigner`s formula:

\[\sigma(E) = \frac{\pi \hbar^2}{2 \mu E} \cdot \frac{(2J + 1)}{(2J_{i} + 1)(2J_{j} + 1)} \cdot \frac{\Gamma_a \Gamma_b}{(E - E_R)^2 + \left( \frac{\Gamma}{2} \right)^2}\]

$P(E; v_{rel})$ comes from Maxwell`s distribution of probability for a pair of particles to have a certain value of total energy in non-inertial frame of reference based on their relative speed:

\[P(E; v_{rel}) = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\sqrt{E - E_{rel}} \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{E - E_{rel}}{k T}\right), & if \ E \geq E_{rel}, \\
0, & if \ E < E_{rel}.
\end{array}
\right.\]

And $P(v_{rel})$ is Maxwell`s probability distribution for relative speed of a pair of particles (not necessarily similar):

\[P(v_{rel}) = 4 \pi \left( \frac{m_{ik}}{2 \pi k T} \right)^{3/2} v_{rel}^2 \exp \left( -\frac{m_{ik} v_{rel}^2}{2 k T} \right)\]

\section{World\_constants:}

\vspace{1em}

Constaints a class "Worldconstants" with names and values of all world constants. Is imported in other modules where its needded as "Wc".

\section{Star\_soft\_main:}

\vspace{1em}

1. Library imports (lines 1-14):
   This section imports the necessary libraries and modules, including datetime for time operations, matplotlib for plotting graphs, numpy for numerical computations, and all other modules for modeling operations.

2. Simulation parameter initialization (lines 17-54):
   This block reads input parameters from the "Simulation\_input.txt" file and initializes them. Important parameters include:
   - $R_{core}$: stellar core radius
   - $ro$: sore density
   - $T$: temperature
   - $T_{surface}$: surface temperature
   - $R_{star}$: stellar radius
   - Mass fractions of elements
   - Time limits and step
   - Solution method (Curant)

3. File opening and creation of main data structures (lines 56-136):
   This section opens necessary input/output files, creates element lists, initializes physical constants (e.g., $\pi$, $e$, nucleon mass $M_{nuc}$, electron mass $M_e$) and creates matrices for various types of reactions (non-resonant, resonant, decay).

4. Initialization of electron and positron concentrations (lines 138-150):
   Initial concentrations of electrons and positrons are calculated based on the condition of stellar electroneutrality.

5. Main simulation loop (lines 170-287):
   This is the core of the program, where step-by-step modeling of stellar core evolution occurs. At each step:
   - Element concentrations are updated
   - Reaction matrices are updated
   - A differentiation step is performed (Curant or Runge-Kutta 4)
   - Element mass fractions, electron and positron concentrations, and temperature are updated
   - Simulation state information is periodically output

6. Results visualization (lines 290-375):
   After the simulation is complete, data is read from the output file and a graph of various stellar parameters' evolution (element mass fractions, electron and positron concentrations, temperature) is plotted as a function of time.
